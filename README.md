# Either

### What?

Sample application to showcase how to handle both success and error API responses with [`Retrofit`](https://github.com/square/retrofit) and `Either<,>` type from [`Arrow-Kt`](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow).

### API mock server

To make it work, a mock server need to be launched on port `3000`. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/vshkl/either-api-sample/blob/main/mock/MockAPI.md).
